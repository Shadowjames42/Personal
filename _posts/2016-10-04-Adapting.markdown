It's been a while. Since the last time I have touched this website, I have moved into my college dorm, and worked my way through half of a semester at IPFW. College is great honestly, but adapting to being 100% responsible for myself is odd. For instance, I went to bed one night after having three cheese sticks, and a Star Crunch. I have also gotten a job since my last post. I work on campus in ITS Inventory, doing mainly salvage work as of right now. That’s all I really have to say for now. I’ll  post again whenever I feel like it.
