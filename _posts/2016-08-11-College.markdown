Chicago was fun, I forgot to post anything, but it was an excellent day. As of right this second, I am 6 days away from moving into my dorm at IPFW, and 11 days from starting classes. All of this change is surreal, but I'm thoroughly excited to go through it. Thank you to every single person they made this possible, you know who you are.
